# Meeting Notes - Sprint 25 Planning

**Date:**
**Attendees:** Priya Menon (Lead), Suresh, Intern

---

## Real-time data aggregation worker

- **Priya Menon:** This is blocking our release. Suresh started the work but got reassigned. @Intern, take this ticket and fix the bugs identified in code review.

- **Suresh:** The core structure is correct but there are two known bugs. Check the PR comments for details. The first issue is the more critical one.

## Action Items

- [ ] @Intern - Fix bugs in `aggregator.go` and `windowManager.go`
- [ ] @Suresh - Code review when PR is ready
- [ ] @Priya Menon - Final sign-off before merge
